I am 20 yeaers old from Karamoja sub region, Amudat district around the Kenya-Uganda boarder. There is enough sun this way, always on the vest
but everything goes on well. I am on my S.4 vacation, planning to go for a course once the schools re-open.
I am very glad i joined EDUoutboxTeencoders because i have been longing to know how to code and develop my carrier.
So far i can create a file in vs code and hopping to know more.
